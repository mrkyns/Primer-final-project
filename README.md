# Primer Final Project

Final project after two weeks within Primer. The task was to create and make a landing page for the blog.
I decided to create my own version of the landing page for the car manufacturer BMW from Bavaria.

station contains four sections:
- Header section - menu
- Hero section - current news and a section that allows you to view models
- blog section - news, information ...
- footer section - information about the business as well as important links.
